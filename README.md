# "Pet Adopt"

## About the project

This is the project developed during the course of MobileApps at NTNU in Autumn 2023. The main project idea is to let users find a lot of alternatives to adopting different animals which are held by many adoption centers. This app will serve as a platform for adoption centers to list animals in need of loving homes and allow users to search for and adopt pets based on specific criteria.
