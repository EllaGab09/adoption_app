# "Pet Adopt"

## About the project

This is the project developed during the course of MobileApps at NTNU in Autumn 2023. The main project idea is to let users find a lot of alternatives to adopting different animals which are held by many adoption centers. This app will serve as a platform for adoption centers to list animals in need of loving homes and allow users to search for and adopt pets based on specific criteria.


## Goals and Impact 

Our primary goal is to facilitate the adoption of pets in need of homes while providing a user-friendly platform for both adoption centers and potential pet parents. We aim to create a sense of community among pet enthusiasts and promote responsible pet ownership.
